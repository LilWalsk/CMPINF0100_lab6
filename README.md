This is the repository for Lab's 6 and 7 for Big Ideas in Computing. 
Our program prompts the user for their birth day, birth month, and birth year respectively. Then given the perameters, it outputs how old the user is if it isn't their birthday, but wishes them a happy birthday if the birthday they entered matches today.
