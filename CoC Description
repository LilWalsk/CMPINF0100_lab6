Our goal here was to find a Code of Conduct that gave an outline as to what our standards were for all those who use/contribute to our open source code. 
We want all contributors and contributions to be met with respect and to not be shelved aside due to factors other than the code itself. 
Ideas and trials are what make open source codes work, a community of people with varying perspectives trying to make better and perfect a given code. 
It is for those reasons that we chose to use this code of conduct.
